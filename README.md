# ROZGAAR-APP 

## Abstract
In India, the daily wage labourers are large in number and their entire day-to-day activities are dependent on the wages they get from daily works. The problem is that due to the large number of workers and them being in small towns many labourers can not get work. So our idea is to not let the labourers search the work but the work to search the labourers.
We will design an application in which contractors will ask for labourers with required skills and based on that weâ€™ll inform the appropriate labourers about the work and its details like, estimated pay, location, type of work etc. Thus any work from nearby areas can be made accessible to the labourers easily.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
First of all download the repository and unzip the file

### Prerequisites
- Sklearn
- Numpy, Pandas

### Running on Your Local Machine
- Run the server
- Run the app through main.py
- You will encounter following screen(image link)
- Register into it if you are a contractor
- If labor then run the following file

## Repositories Files
There are 3 folders and a main.py for running test.

- database (Includes the database files)
- model (Include the ML model files which will predict the scores of laborers)
- rozgaar (Includes all flutter files for the app design)
